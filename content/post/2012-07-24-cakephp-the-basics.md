CakePHP is a PHP framework to easily build MVC applications. To install it clone the repository on GitHub

    
    git clone https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp.git cakephp-2.2.1
    git checkout 2.2.1


Now we can use the Cake code generator from command line - it's called `bake` and is run like `cake bake`. The path to the `cake` executable (really a tiny shell script which invokes the real PHP-cli one) is like `cake-2.2.1/lib/Cake/Console/cake`. For convenience, you can add this to your `PATH`. We are now ready to generate the skeleton of the directory structure plus common files required by a CakePHP application:

    
    cake bake


Bake will ask you the path of the project, the credentials for accessing the database and so on. You can keep the default for the majority of the settings<!--more-->. Let's see what files/directory bake just created:

Now, enable `mod_rewrite` on your Apache webserver (or the equivalent) and point a browser to `http://localhost/myapp`. You will see an error asking you to set the value for the Cake library files under the constant `CAKE_CORE_INCLUDE_PATH` in `webroot/index.php`. Before setting this, it's time to init the git repository for our new project:

    
    git init
    find . -empty -type d -not -iwholename '*/.git/*' -exec touch '{}'/EMPTY \;
    touch README.md
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git remote add origin $URL
    git push -u origin master


(Note that the `find` on line 2 is there to preserve the directory structure in git). Now it's time to configure the cake path seen above, but we don't want to put the edit in Git. Finally, we'll add a `.gitignore` with the `tmp/` directory as the only content

    
    git update-index --assume-unchanged webroot/index.php
    # uncomment around line 60 in the file
    echo "tmp/" >> .gitignore
    git add .gitignore
    git commit -m "Added .gitignore"


It's time to see out app in a browser window
[![](http://zybnet.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/CakePHP-the-rapid-development-php-framework-Home.png)](http://zybnet.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/CakePHP-the-rapid-development-php-framework-Home.png)
What can be seen here is a `View` rendered by the `PagesController`. Here is the flow



	
  1. The browser issues a `HTTP GET /myapp/`

	
  2. Cake reads its routing table (defined in `Config/routes.php`) and finds the line matching `/`

	
  3. `PagesController` invokes its Â `display` method


These are the main components when dealing a Cake app: first you write a `Controller` and its associated `View`, then you declare a `route` and finally define the DB part: database + `Model` (in the case of the `PagesController`, it really doesn't store contents in a db, but access raw files stored under `View/Page/`

In the next post, we'll enhance the `PagesController` by adding authentication and database storage
