I don't know C, but as a seasoned Java programmer (not to mention that I do a lot of scripting) I really didn't expect:



	
  * Makefile are idiotic (tab is significant!)

	
  * You need those stupid header files

	
  * Shared Objects are a mess

	
  * The order of the arguments on the GCC command line matters!
